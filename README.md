maincli file is most likely the operating system
in the future commands will be their own thing

lexer is a component to the languages i am going to add, most likely will be available on RFD

pacmanref is the table of urls for the RFD service

i would rather you not modify code but whenever the new installer comes about it would be considerably harder to mod the OS.
